# Work Log Day 1051

After over two years of not posting an update, I step back into the ring to obliterate the Convolutional Neural Network part of OptPresso. This project started off originally as a means to show that neural networks weren't quite as powerful as the claims I was hearing at the time as well as to learn a bit more about machine learning. A stroke of bad luck lead to early results that looked positive (IE regressed to the mean) and so I spent almost two years collecting images of coffee grounds trying to get a useful CNN model, which never happened. However along the way I started playing around with Gaussian process and Gradient Boosting, the latter of which has provided quite a bit of utility.

I have cleared out all of the CNN related code in hopes that I can invest in simpler models going forward to get better results. The following are some of the projects that I am considering for the future:

* More generic way of building Gradient Boosting models
* Active learning for coffee optimization
* Play around with additional features for training (grind size, agtron, density)
* More experiments
